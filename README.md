# 🚚 Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates food delivery time based on historical order and operational data. The objective is to help businesses set accurate expectations, allocate resources efficiently, and improve customer satisfaction.

## 📊 Project Overview

Despite having operational data, the company lacks a system that can predict delivery time based on real-world conditions such as:

- Distance (km)
- Food preparation time (min)
- Courier’s delivery experience (years)
- Traffic and weather conditions

This project addresses that gap using a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) modeling.
